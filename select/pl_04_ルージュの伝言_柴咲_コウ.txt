I have heard enough
About your infidelity
So I'm on the train
And you are recent history
Didn't take long
For you to start to play and
break
all your solemn promises
The ones you make last week with
your"I do"
You've been bein bad
And boy the rumor traveled fast
You can't change your ways
And I don't think our love can
last
Why did you think
I'd silently take all your same
silly immaturity?
I will scream and cry cause it's
all true
I'm gonna tell your mother
Cause it happened again
I'll tell your brother too
And you'll be oh so sorry then
oh yeah
Maybe you'll grow up
When you go home and read the
mirror
I've left a lipstick message
there my darling
(I'll tell your mother mother
I'll tell your mother)
Calling you some names
Is still a possibility
Making up with you
For now is not a certainty
Better believe the things you
read when you get home
And come back to reality
Cause I'm going home to tell
your mom
I'm gonna tell your mother
Cause it happened again
I'll tell your brother too
And you'll be oh so sorry then
oh yeah
Maybe you'll grow up
When you go home and read the
mirror
I've left a lipstick message
there my darling
I've left a lipstick message
there my darling
